Project: EAF-Nansen Programme
CruiseId: 2019404
CruiseName: Mesopelagic Transect Walvis Bay - Walvis Ridge
CruisePurpose: The overall objective of the survey is to study the acoustic properties and biological composition of the mesopelagic community along a transect spanning from inshore eutrophic coastal waters off Walvis Bay, Namibia, towards eutrophic oceanic waters near the Walvis Ridge. Mesopelagic fish: • Obtain concurrent information on the acoustical properties and biological composition of the mesopelagic community • Study the acoustic properties of mesopelagic fish and other mesopelagic organisms such as e.g. squids, crustaceans, gelationous organisms and principal zooplankton taxa including their frequency response and target strength • Monitor vertical movements of scattering layers or their components • Investigate the effectiveness of sampling gear on the mesopelagic community • Understand the trophic role through collecting samples for analysis of C and N stable isotope ratios and fatty acid composition • Draft a sampling protocol for the mesopelagic abundance estimation surveys. Hydrography: • To map the hydrographic/environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, nutrients and pH values-acidity). • To collect data on light penetration Zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish • To describe the abundance and biomass patterns of meso-zooplankton community, as well as its species composition along the productivity gradient and to determine changes in the meso-zooplankton vertical distribution patterns at the 24 h stations. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of ichthyoplankton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level along the productivity gradient with special focus on the early life history stages of mesopelagic taxa • To elucidate the trophic pathways of dominant mesopelagic larval fish taxa across development • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies for the purposes of confirming identity, determining population structure and establishing regional and global connectivity, c) histological examination of reproductive maturity to determine reproductive synchronicity and semelparity within populations and individuals, and d) stable isotope analysis to determine trophic position. Project name: Theme 3 – Abundance and productivity of non-exploited resources mesopelagic fish and jellyfish Coordinating body: Institute of Marine Research, Bergen
