CruiseId: 2019409
CruiseName: TRANSBOUNDARY DEMERSAL AND PELAGIC RESOURCES AND ECOSYSTEMS IN THE WESTERN GULF OF GUINEA - Leg 3.1 Ghana and Côte Ivoire
CruisePurpose: The main objective of Leg 3.1 is to cover demersal and pelagic resources of the continental shelf and upper slope with a regional survey that allows for synoptic overview of distribution and abundance of resources that may be shared across the region. In addition to determining distribution and abundance of demersal and pelagic species and communities, and collecting biological samples as specified below, sampling will be carried out to determine oceanographic conditions (including physical, chemical and biological), sampling for microplastics and recording the occurrence of marine debris. Specific objectives: 1. Hydrography: • To map the hydrographic and environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, pH and ocean currents). • To obtain information on the dissolved oxygen concentrations, ocean acidification state and calcium carbonate saturation horizon relevant for calcifying organisms. 2. Primary productivity, zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish • To describe the primary productivity and the abundance and biomass patterns of phytoplankton of the region. • To describe the abundance and biomass patterns of meso-zooplankton community, as well as its species composition. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of ichthyoplankton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level. • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies for the purposes of confirming identity, determining population structure and establishing regional and global connectivity, c) histological examination of reproductive maturity to determine reproductive synchronicity and semelparity within populations and individuals, and d) stable isotope analysis to determine trophic position and role. 3. Demersal resources • Distribution and abundance of demersal resources using the swept-area method • Biological parameters for priority species (length, weight, maturity). • Identification of spawning/nursery area Brachydeuterus auritus Epinephelus aenus Dentex canariensis Dentex angolensis Galeoides decadactylus Lutjanus spp Pagellus bellottii Penaeus notalis Pseudotolithus spp Sepia hierredda Cynoglossus spp Pentanemus quinquarius Pomadasys spp 4. Pelagic resources • Distribution and abundance of pelagic resources using the acoustic method and trawling for target identification. • To collect samples for genetic analysis (stock identification) of Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis, Scomber colias, Trachurus trecae. • To obtain information on maturity stages of S. aurita and S. maderensis, S. colias and T. trecae. 5. Record occurrence of top predators 6. Map the occurrence of microplastics and describe associated neustonic communities. 7. Record the occurrence of marine debris (surface). 8. Record the occurrence of floating seaweed aggregations (Sargassum sp.) and collect opportunistic samples for genetic studies.
