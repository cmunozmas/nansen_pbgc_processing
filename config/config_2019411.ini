CruiseId: 2019411
CruiseName: Pelagic Resources Mapping Senegal
CruisePurpose: Survey objectives Pelagic resources: • To obtain information on abundance, distribution and size compositions of main pelagic stocks using acoustic methods and a systematic grid survey strategy. • To collect samples for morphometric (whole fish and otholiths) and genetic analysis (for stock identification of Sardinella aurita and Scomber colias). • To obtain information on maturity stages of S. aurita, Sardinella maderensis, Sardina pilchardus, S. colias and Engraulis encrasicolus. Food safety and pollution: • To collect samples for levels of environmental contaminants, nutrients, parasites and microorganisms with regards to food safety and pollution of selected species, specifically S. aurita and S. maderensis. Hydrography: • To map the hydrographic and environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, total alkalinity, pH and ocean currents) • To obtain information on the dissolved oxygen concentrations, ocean acidification state, and calcium carbonate saturation horizon relevant for calcifying organisms. • Primary productivity, zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish: • To describe the primary productivity and the abundance and biomass patterns of phytoplankton of the region. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of ichthyoplakton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level. • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies for the purposes of confirming identity, determining population structure and establishing regional and global connectivity, c) histological examination of reproductive maturity to determine reproductive synchronicity and semelparity within populations and individuals, and d) stable isotope analysis to determine trophic position and role. Marine debris and pollution: • To map the occurrence of microplastics. • To record the occurrence of marine debris in surface waters. • To record the occurrence of floating seaweed aggregations (Sargassum sp.) and collect opportunistic samples for genetic studies. • To obtain information on trace metal concentrations in sea water. Top predators: • To register the occurrence of marine mammals and seabirds.
