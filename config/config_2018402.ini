CruiseId: 2018402
CruiseName: Indian Ocean 2018 - Leg 1
CruisePurpose: Survey objectives: Hydrography • To map the hydrographic/environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, nutrients, total alkalinity and pH values) Phytoplankton, zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish: • To establish as far as possible, the distribution, abundance and composition of phyto- and zooplankton (incluing jellyfish), and species composition of fish eggs and larvae. Pelagic and demersal stocks: • To obtain information on abundance, distribution (also by size) of the main pelagic fish species, and also considering the pelagic sub-groups PEL 1 (clupeids, engraulids) and PEL2 (carangids, scombrids, barracudas, hairtail), using acoustic methods in a systematic grid survey strategy and conducting targeted trawling • To obtain information on abundance, distribution (also by size) of the main demersal fish species, crustaceans and squids, using a swept area method with bottom trawls • To collect information on maturity stages, for the main pelagic fish, demersal fish, crustaceans and squids • To collect samples for genetic analysis for stock identification for selected species • To collect stomach samples for analysis of contents (diet) including microplastics. Mesopelagic fish: • To identify the main species and collect samples for identification and isotope analysis. Marine debris and pollution: • To record occurrence of marine debris (surface) • To collect samples for levels of nutrients and contaminants including microplastics in the marine environment • To map occurrence of microplastics and describe associated neuston communities. Contaminants: • To collect samples of fish species consumed locally, the most abundant/less exploited depthwater fish species and other indicator species such as soles, for analysis of contaminant levels and nutrient values. • Sediments and benthos: • To carry out detailed bottom habitat studies (in selected areas). Project name: Strengthening the Knowledge Base for and Implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Marine Fisheries in Developing Countries (EAF-Nansen GCP/INT/003/NOR) Coordinating body: Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries, Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway
