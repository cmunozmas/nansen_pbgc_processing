Project: EAF-Nansen Programme
CruiseId: 2021401
CruiseName: Bottom habitat mapping Northwest Africa – Leg 1
CruisePurpose: This survey aims at developing a baseline for present and future monitoring of possible impacts of the oil and gas activities on benthic ecosystems in the seas of Mauritania and Senegal, between 17 and 15oN. Priority areas have been identified by partners from the region and are partly based on the knowledge of the occurrence of vulnerable benthic ecosystems (i.e. cold-water coral reefs), the localization of oil and gas exploration and production sites, and partly follows a systematic survey design attempting to capture as large part of the natural environmental gradient in the survey area as possible. During the cruise, samples will be collected along 6 transects stretching from shallow coastal waters (>40 m) to 2000 meters depth on the continental slope with each transect consisting of 6 sampling stations. Furthermore, video surveys of the sea-bed (i.e. habitat mapping) will be carried out at appointed sites.
