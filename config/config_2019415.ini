CruiseId: 2019415
CruiseName: MESOPELAGIC TRANSECT NW AFRICA - Leg 4.5 
CruisePurpose: The main objective of Leg 4.5 is to continue collecting data on acoustics properties, biology and diversity of mesopelagic fish and associated fish and plankton communities along a transect from productive waters on the shelf to oligotrophic waters offshore. The data and samples are meant to fulfil the scientific objectives agreed as part of Theme 3 of the Science Plan. A list of research projects was identified in connection with a post-survey meeting held in Rome in November 2018 and updated at a meeting held in Swakopmund in May 2019. Sampling is meant to support projects as part of the following objectives: 1. Develop standardised survey techniques and sampling protocols for mesopelagic species a. Improve the knowledge of the acoustical properties (volume backscattering strength, Sv and target strengths, TS) of mesopelagic organisms across different acoustic carrier frequencies b. Investigate the representativity of net samples of mesopelagic organisms by means of comparative sampling with especially developed sampling trawls c. Apply optical sampling of mesopelagic species and jellyfish using camera probes and trawl-based camera systems d. Investigate the occurrence of resonance at lower fisheries carrier frequencies (18 and 38 kHz) in mesopelagic scattering layers 2. Determine abundance, distribution and diversity across regions a. Describe the taxonomic composition and diversity of mesopelagic communities along productivity gradients in disparate marine ecosystems surrounding the African continent and other regions covered by the surveys with Dr. F. Nansen b. Establish regional and inter-regional trends in abundance (volume density) and diversity index in mesopelagic communities from abundance/habitat-model/environmental data 3. Ecological function a. Elucidate trophic flows and interactions of mesopelagic fish by examining tissue samples for C and N stable isotopes and fatty acids b. Examine genetic connectivity between populations/ stocks of mesopelagic species using molecular methods (within and between regions) c. Determine biomass and major taxon composition of zooplankton and phytoplankton to understand ecological linkages and for abundance modelling d. the role of mesopelagic fish as prey and their ecosystem services e. Develop the scientific knowledge base for evaluating the potential of mesopelagic species for sustainable harvest (growth, mortality, reproduction, recruitment and migration of selected species) f. Study the early life history stages of mesopelagic fish Project name: EAF- Nansen program Coordinating body: Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries, Institute of Marine Research, Norway
