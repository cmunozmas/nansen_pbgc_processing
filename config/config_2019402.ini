CruiseId: 2019402
CruiseName: South Africa demersal
CruisePurpose: South Africa demersal Covering the west coast of South Africa from 20 to 800 m depth, from the south (20 degrees east) to the border with Namibia, following the survey design as during the 2010 survey, including of the position of the trawl stations. 1. Hydrography • To map the hydrographic/environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, nutrients and pH values-acidity). Obtain information on the oxygen concentrations and ocean acidification state and calcium carbonate saturation horizon, relevant for calcifying organisms. 2. Zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish • To describe the abundance and biomass patterns of mesozooplankton community, as well as its species composition. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of ichthyoplakton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level. • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies for the purposes of confirming identity, determining population structure and establishing regional and global connectivity, c) histological examination of reproductive maturity to determine reproductive synchronicity and semelparity within populations and individuals, and d) stable isotope analysis to determine trophic position and role. 3. Demersal resources • Continuation of demersal time-series for the West Coast of South Africa and Namibia, starting from Demersal survey off South Africas west coast. The survey will cover the following: o Distribution and stock structure – hake (both species), monkfish, kingklip (catch composition in trawl, length frequency data and biological data as well as any environmental (CTD) and acoustic data relevant to study the distribution patterns of the above mentioned species). o Stock structure – genetic samples of monkfish, kingklip. o Parasites as biotags: Some parasite assemblage data on both of the hake species as well as monkfish and angelfish have been collected o Fecundity studies – hake (both species). Specific studies are around spawning patterns where data regarding POFs assessment to effect investigations on spawning fraction is lacking. o Juvenile hake species identification and distribution: Data for juvenile hake species identification and distribution is needed for comparative studies. A comparison of the distribution and size structure of catches of juvenile hake by the two vessels (R/V Africana and R/V Dr Fridtjof Nansen) may be interesting. o Benthic studies: collection of benthic invertebrate data for species identification and species composition. 4. Pelagic resources: Opportunistically collect samples of Cape horse mackerel (T. capensis) and Scomber colias for genetic analysis. 5. Map occurrence of microplastics and describe associated neustonic communities 6. Survey marine top predators, marine mammals and seabirds
