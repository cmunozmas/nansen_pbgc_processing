CruiseId: 2018410
CruiseName: SURVEY OF REGIONAL RESOURCES AND ECOSYSTEM OFF BAY OF BENGAL - Leg 3.3 
CruisePurpose: Survey objectives; • To map the hydrographic/environmental conditions in the survey area • To collect samples for levels of nutrients and environmental contaminants, including microplastics, and with regards to food safety and pollution. • To identify the main species and collect samples for identification and genetic analysis. • To collect samples for levels of nutrients and contaminants including microplastics. • To record occurrence of marine debris (surface). • To map occurrence of microplastics • To collect samples of fish species consumed locally for analysis of content of contaminants • What is the abundance and potential of pelagic fish species on the continental shelf? • What is the abundance, diversity and ecological role of mesopelagic fish in the Bay of Bengal? Project name: Strengthening the Knowledge Base for and Implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Marine Fisheries in Developing Countries (EAF-Nansen GCP/INT/003/NOR) Coordinating body: Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries, Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway
