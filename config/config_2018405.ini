CruiseId: 2018405
CruiseName: MESOPELAGIC TRANSECT TANZANIA-SEYCHELLES
CruisePurpose: The main objectives of this transect are to: • Map circulation structure including meso-scale eddies in the westernmost part of the Eastern Equatorial Current • Map the current structure of the Equatorial Current between Outer Islands and Victoria. • Map plankton distribution related to the meso-scale eddy structure • Determine abundance and distribution of mesopelagic fish • Analyze pollutant substances in mesopelagic fish Mesopelagic fish: • To obtain concurrent information on the acoustical properties and biological composition of the mesopelagic community • To study the acoustic properties of mesopelagic fish and other mesopelagic organisms such as e.g. salps, medusae and other macrozooplankton including their frequency response and target strength • Investigate the effectiveness of sampling gear on the mesopelagic community • Draft a sampling protocol for mesopelagic fish assessment • To collect samples for levels of nutrients and contaminants including microplastics Project name: 15113 EAF-Nansen Programme 2017-2021 Coordinating body: FAO
