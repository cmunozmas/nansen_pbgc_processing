CruiseId: 2019412
CruiseName: Hydrography Mauritania
CruisePurpose: Survey objectives Hydrography: • To map the hydrographic and environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, total alkalinity, pH and ocean currents) • To obtain information on the dissolved oxygen concentrations, ocean acidification state, and calcium carbonate saturation horizons relevant for calcifying organisms. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and ichthyoplankton: • To describe the primary productivity of the region • To describe the abundance and biomass patterns of meso-zooplankton community, as well as its species composition. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of ichthyoplankton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level. • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies for the purposes of confirming identity, determining population structure and establishing regional and global connectivity, and c) histological examination of reproductive maturity to determine reproductive synchronicity and semelparity within populations and individuals. Pelagic stocks: • To obtain information on abundance, distribution (also by size) of Sardinella aurita, Sardinella maderensis, Engraulis encrasicolus, Trachurus trecae, Trachurus Trachurus, Scomber colias and Sardina pilchardus using acoustic methods and a systematic grid survey strategy; • To collect samples for genetic analysis and for morphometric studies and genetic analysis (for stock identification of S. aurita and S. maderensis); • To obtain information on maturity stages, and to collect stomach samples for analysis of contents and otoliths of S. aurita, S. maderensis, S. pilchardus, S. colias and E. encrasicolus. Mesopelagic fish: • To trawl for samples of mesopelagic fish in deep waters (as time permits) Top predators: • To record occurrence of top predators. Marine debris and microplastics: • To record occurrence of marine debris and sargassum weed (surface); • To map occurrence of microplastics and describe associated neuston communities. Contaminants: • To collect samples of specific pelagic species for levels of environmental contaminants, nutrients, parasites and microorganisms with regards to food safety and pollution Project name: Strengthening the Knowledge Base for and Implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Marine Fisheries in Developing Countries (EAF-Nansen GCP/INT/003/NOR) Coordinating body: Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries, Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway
