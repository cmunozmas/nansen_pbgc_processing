CruiseName: Southern Namibia - demersal Survey
CruisePurpose: Southern Namibia - demersal Survey covered the continental shelf and slope in Namibia between the 30 to 600 m isobaths, from the border with South Africa until Walvis Bay. Survey objectives Hydrography • To map the hydrographic and environmental conditions in the survey area (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, nutrients and pH) and to obtain information on the dissolved oxygen concentrations, ocean acidification state and aragonite saturation state relevant for calcifying organisms. • To identify oceanographic links of Orange Banks with adjacent regions north and south. • To collect data for the oceanographic model of Orange Banks • Collect hydrographic data along standard MFMR Monthly Oceanographic Monitoring (MOM) lines as part of the Ministrys oceanographic time-series. Zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and jellyfish • To describe the abundance and biomass patterns of the mesozooplankton community, as well as its species composition. • To provide information on the abundance patterns of the ichthyoplankton community (fish eggs and larvae), at the lowest possible taxonomic level. • To collect samples of jellyfish for a) morphological identification and taxonomic studies, b) genetic studies, and d) stable isotope analysis to determine trophic position and role. Demersal resources The key objective of Leg 2.2 is to provide information on the biomass, distribution and stock structure of both species of hake, the species composition (catch composition) and also to provide data on the following: • To collect standard biological data (length frequency, length-weight, sex and maturity) for both species of hake, also length and length-weight for monkfish and kingklip, as well as any other commercial species that may be abundant in the trawls. • To collect environmental data using CTD casts at most trawl stations to enable subsequent studies investigating the distribution of the key demersal stocks and the environment. • To monitor the acoustic data to ascertain if the target species (primarily hakes) occur above the trawl headline and hence are not available to the gear, and also for subsequent studies that are relevant to the distribution patterns of the above-mentioned species. • To collect genetic samples to enable studies of the stock structure of hakes and key by-catch species: monkfish, kingklip, horse mackerel and Spanish mackerel. • To collect samples of hakes, monkfish and kingklip to enable the study parasite assemblages as biotags, and morphometric studies, supporting data already collected, and also allowing comparisons with South African samples. • To collect gonadal samples for fecundity studies of both species of hake for studies of the spawning patterns. • To opportunistically collect data on the distribution and species identification of juvenile hake for comparative studies of the distribution and size structure of catches of juvenile hake by the two vessels (R/V Africana and R/V Dr Fridtjof Nansen). • To collect samples of juveniles of both species of hake as part of an investigation into identification using vertebrate counts • To collect benthic invertebrates from both trawls and sediment samples for species identification and species composition studies Pelagic resources • To opportunistically collect samples of Cape horse mackerel (T. capensis) and Scomber colias for genetic analysis and morphometric studies Microplastics and neuston communities • To map occurrence and abundance of microplastics and the associated neustonic communities Marine mammals and seabirds • To establish the distribution (including migratory) and relative abundance of whales, dolphins and seabirds on the coast of southern Namibia Mesopelagic fish, cephalopod and crustaceans • To collect mesopelagic fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans Project: EAF-Nansen program Coordin: Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries, Inst of Marine Research Norway
