CruiseId: 2019702
CruiseName: ECOgaps
CruisePurpose: The aim of the ECOgaps cruise is to improve the knowledgebase for the management of the King Haakon VII Sea extending from the coast of the Dronning Maud Land. ECOgaps. Specifically we focussed on a part of the MPA planning Domain 4 (CCAMLR - Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) extending from the 0 meridian to the Astrid ridge (13E, See Fig. 1). We ran different CTD sections sampling for primary production, chemistry and oceanography across the Astrid ridge, at 6 E and Maud Rise and along one section. Along the route we registered krill swarms and the mesopelagic layer using the echosounder. At occasions, we trawled for krill and the mesopelagic layer. At 4 occasions we ran a bottom transect with an ROV filming and collecting material using the ROV itself and RP sled and bottom net. On all the transects we also set a long line and ran a multinet tows.
